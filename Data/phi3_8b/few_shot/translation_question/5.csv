Dasapywa (invert of ""good"" + ""more"") - Worse in the sense that it is not as good and has lesser quality or quantity than something else. It implies a negative comparison, similar to how 'worse' functions in English when comparing two things where one lacks certain qualities present in another.";;

Fun to see the connection between ""sya"" meaning ""and,"" and using it in a sentence about loving someone, which is similar to saying ""I like."" The term ""tamye"" translates as ""fun,"" so when combined with ""i yoy plu sya i yoy hay e tamye!"" we can understand the sentiment expressed.

Translation: I love you too! Fun to see that connection between 'and' and liking someone, which is similar to saying 'I like.'";;
